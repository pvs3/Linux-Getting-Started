**cd** : Change dir

```
cd
-> returns to 'home dir' eg: for user 'penguin' = /home/penguin

cd ..
-> moves one dir UP
```

**pwd** : Print (actual)working dir = 'where am I now ?'

```
pwd
/home/penguin
```

**mkdir** : Make dir

```
mkdir -p /home/penguin/AWS/BigData/Mobile
-> -p = make all 'parent dirs if they do not exist !
```

**find**

```
find . -type f -name 'test*'                    -> return all files under this dir starting with 'test'
find . -type f -iname 'test*'                   -> idem but 'i' makes it CASE INSENSITIVE !!

find . -type f -name '*.json' -maxdepth 1        -> search only 1 dir deep = 'this dir'
find . -type f -name '*json' -maxdepth 1 -exec rm {} +
                                                -> executes 'rm' on all found files in THIS dir (+=end)


find . -type f mmin -10                         -> find changed files < 10 minutes in this dir.
find . -type f mmin +5 mmin -15                 -> returns chenged file between 5 and 15 min
find . -type f mtime -10                        ->  returns files changed within last 10 days
find . -type f ctime

find / -name "*.json" -print 2>/dev/null        -> find under root('/'), all 'json-files' and blackhole errors (2=stderr) (cfr permission denied)
find / -user penguin -name "Book*" -print 2>/dev/null

find / -size +5M                        -> find files > 5M in root dir (use k=KiloByte and G=Giga)
find / -empty                           -> find all O byte files

find / -perm 777

find myWebsite -exec chown penguin:www-data {} +
                                        -> -exec .. to execute a cmd
                                        -> user=penguin group=www-data
                                        -> {} placholder for find result and + ='end of exec'
find myWebsite -type d -exec chmod 775 {} +
                                        -> sets all dir+subdir permissions to 775
find myWebsite -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +
                                        -> sets all file permissions to 644
!Check it!
find myWebsite -chmod 775
ind myWebsite -chmod 664
```

**grep** Global Regular Expression Print

**umask**

Dicates the default file permission set.

How ?

- umask = 0022 (default)
- permissions = 0666 -umask = 0644 (rx-|r--|r--)

**ps**

    ps (with no '-') = BSD syntax
    ps - = Unix/Linux syntax

    Mixing both, BSD and Unix/Linux, can become confusing!

**remark = both are different !!!** eg 'ps aux >< ps -aux'

```
ps              -> shows running **processes** in current shell' (default ps is filtered!)
ps -f           -> show 'full' (details) -including 'Parent PIP = PPID'
ps -l           -> show 'long' (details) -> even more then '-f'
ps -e == ps -A  -> shows 'all' processes or deamon = process with no relation to tty
ps -a           -> shows 'all' processes - -related with tty terminal
ps -u           -> add 'user info'
ps -aux         -> show 'all' (-a) processes for 'user'(-u) and 'user=x(all users)'
ps -aupenguin   -> show 'all' (-a) processes for 'user'(-u) and 'user=penguin'
ps x            -> !BSD notation! = lift the tty restriction
ps a            -> !BSD notation! = lift the 'only yourself restriction
ps u            -> !BSD notation! = full details (u user oriented format)
ps aux          -> !BSD notation! = all processes
ps ax == ps -ef -> (a all process) == (-e every process long_format)
```

**top**

Shows top processes

```
top
```

**kill**

```
kill 1297       -> kills process PID=1297
```

## 2 Users

### 2.1 Password file

- file location = /etc/passwd
- stored in ETSI format = 7 fields

<img src="/images/passwd-file.png" width="800px">

example:

<img src="/images/get_passwd_details4user.png" width="500px">

### 2.2 Adding and deleting users

```
useradd penguin -m -s /bin/bash -g users
-> -m = create home dir for this user (/home/penguin)
-> -s = default bash for this user
-> -g = belongs to group
```

How to delete a user?

```
userdel -rf polarbear       -> -r deletes /home/polarbear dir + mail -f = force (even if logged in)
```

**Remark:** you have to have permission in order to create users , usually 'root'.

### 2.3 groups

```
groupadd -g 916 testers         -> adds a group (see /etc/group) with id=916 named 'testers'
```

How to make a user be member of multiple groups? -> edit /etc/group and add all groups (separated with ',')

```
penguin:x:1000:users,testers    -> user 'penguin' now member of 'users' and 'testers
```

### 2.4 sudo

Remark: You have to : 'apt-get install sudo' (sometimes sudo is not installed-> no '/etc/sudoers' file)

If everybody can login as root -> BAD. Because in case of problem there is no way of actually knowing who did it. Solution = give specific users 'root rights' and then they can perform 'sudo ...' under there login account.

```
cat /etc/group          -> lists all the (user)groups
cat /etc/sudoers        -> add user to
passwd penguin          -> as 'root' we can set anybody's password!
```

Config: /etc/sudoers

How to add a user to 'sudo' ?

1. login as 'root'
2. Create user: 'useradd penguin -m -s /bin/bash -g users'
3. Create passwd: 'passwd penguin'
4. Add user to sudoers: 'usermod -aG sudo penguin'
5. test:

   - 'su penguin'
   - 'sudo ls /root' -> if access then ok :-)

## 3 Files

**Everything is a file in linux !**

### 3.1 Filesystem hierarchy

<img src="images/linux_file_system.png" width="800px">

    - '/' = root dir

    - '/root'   = home dir for root user -> ! not in /home
    - '/bin'    = dir for programs
    - '/boot'   = files required for starting your system -> 'DO NOT TOUCH !!'
    - '/dev'    = contains device files
                    - null  = 'black hole' eg:as stdout for files - /dev/null
                    - tty   = 'teletype' = your terminal window
                    - ttyS0 = serial port (physical device)
                    - pts   = 'pseudo terminal slave' = remote connections eg SSH (no physical device)

                    **remark**
                    - c = 'Character device' -> eg see tty
                    - b = 'block device' = acts as a disk
    - '/etc'    = Everything To Configure -> contains mainly configuration files (eg passwd file, ...)
    - '/home'   = dir for working dir for users. eg: /home/penguin or /home/user2
    - '/lib'    = Libraries
    - '/lib64'  = 64 - bit libraries
    - '/media'  = external plugable media (mainly storage) eg USB drives
    - '/mnt'     = mount = for manualy mounting drives. Today not used very much (? except Docker ?)
    - '/opt'    = for installation of add-on software.
                    <strong>remark: <\strong> there is a subtile difference between /opt and /usr/local
    - '/proc'   = virtual dir - created every launch- with info about your computer: CPU, kernel, etc
    - '/run'    = (new dir) where system processes write temp data -> DO NOT TOUCH !!
    - '/sbin'   = dir for 'superuser' programs (eg fdisk)
    - '/usr'    = was home dir for users in the 'early days'. Now mish-mash of directory with: apps,libs,docs,wallpaper,icons, etc
    - '/srv'    = dir for servers. eg: /srv/www (with html for your site) or /srv/ftp
    - '/sys'    = virtual dir - contains info about connected devices -> DO NOT TOUCH !!
    - '/tmp'    = tempory dir mainly used by runnings applications
    - '/var'    = mainly used for log files

**Remark : ** - '~' = short for home dir, for user 'penguin' this is: /home/penguin

### 3.2 File security

    - first char = file type
    - permission Classes (user, group, Other users)
        - read / write / execute (r/w/x)
        - ther is a subtile difference between 'Other' and 'All -> see Chmod 3.4
    ```
                |  r w x | r w x | r w x
    file type   |  user  | group | Other
        x       |  x x x | x x x | x x x
    ```

example:

<img src="/images/file_example.png" width="600px">

```
                |  r w x | r w x | r w x
    file type   |  user  | group | Other
        -       |  1 1 0 | 1 0 0 | 1 0 0
        -       |    6   |   4   |   4    == chmod 644 == user can read/write and rest can read
```

**remark:** | 1 1 1 | == 7 => chmod 777 set read/write/execute for user/group/all = max privilage <br> Also called: **symbolic notation** versus **numeric notation**

<img src="/images/file_example_chmod777.png" width="600px">

**first char**

```
* - : regular file
* d : directory
* l : symbilic link
* c : device file of type character (see /dev/tty)
* b : device file of type block (see /dev/sd)
* s : socket
* p : pipe
* D : Door (only on Solaris)
```

### 3.3 Links

2 types:

- 'ln' hardlinks -> They share **Inode** number (? disk-file partition)
- 'ln -s' symbolic links -> They ** DO NOT** share Inode numbers (have different Inode nr)

**Remarks :**

Sharing or not sharing same Inode has major consequences: rem: 'ls -i' gives Inode number

**HardLinks**

- links are 'pointers' to the same Inode
  - file type = '-'
  - Thus if file to which the link refered is deleted -> link stays intact because Inode nr stiil exists
  - if Chmod on file -> this is on Inode -> thus for ALL links

<img src="/images/hard_link.png" width="600px">

**Symbolic Links**

- links point to **different** Inode
  - file type = 'l' = link
  - it only references the absolute path name
  - Thus if file to which the link refered is deleted -> = destroyed -> abs path point to nothing
  - permission of link is always 777 -> Permission of 'destination file' determines what can!!

<img src="/images/symbolic_link.png" width="800px">

### 3.4 Chmod - changing permissions

### 3.4.1 Changing permissions on files

Intro: Difference for files and directories !

    -> for files r w x = evident
    -> for dir:
        - r = you can ls dir
        - w = you can 'cp' files into dir
        - x = you can 'cd' into dir

Remark: You can not have execute -x permission without read -r permission

See 'man chmod'

**Format symbolic mode:** <br>

- ugoa
  - u = user
  - g = group
  - o = other
  - a = all = u+G+o !!! (see remark 3.2 subtile difference)

```
chmod u=rwx myfile.txt          -> sets rwx to user
chmod u-x   myfile.txt          -> prohibits x (execution) for user
chmod u+x   myScript            -> adds x permission tot user
```

<img src="/images/chmod_symbolic.png" width="600px">

**Format numeric mode:** <br>

rwx = \_ \_ \_ in binary

eg:

    - 000 == ---|---|---
    - 400 == 100|000|000 == r--|---|---
    - 644 == 110|100|100 == rw-|r--|r--
    - 775 == 111|111|101 == rwx|rwx|r-x
    - 777 == 111|111|111 == rwx|rwx|rwx

```
chmod 644 myfile.txt          -> sets rw-|r--|r--
chmod 777 myfile.txt          -> sets rwx|rwx|rwx
```

### 3.4.2 Changing permissions on directories

First line specifies permissions of the actual dir (see 'dot' at the end)

<img src="/images/dir_permissions.png" width="600px">

```
chmod 755 .         -> sets the permissions as above on the actual directory
```

### 3.4.3 ACL

Remark: if cmd not found -> run 'apt-get install acl'

ACL = Access List

-> if applied we see a '.' at the end of the permissions <br> -> enables us to give specific permissions to users

**getfacl**

<img src="/images/getfacl.png" width="600px">

**setfacl**

<img src="/images/setfacl.png" width="800px">
```
setfacl --modify u:pengiun:777 mysecretFile.txt
```
<img src="/images/getfacl.png" width="600px">

Now we see a '+' at the end of the permissions indicating one or more additional 'acl'

<img src="/images/ls_acl.png" width="600px">

## 4 Bash

Bash = Born Again Shell

    - Standard Input    - default = keyboard
    - Standard Output   - default = display
    - Standard Error    - default = display

- '\*' = match anything zero or more
- '?' = match anything but only one char
- '[a-z]' = match a lowercase char between a and z
- '!' = for running a cmd nr
- ';' = for separating and executing multiple commands

```
ls Pete*        -> will match 'Pete', 'Peter', Petersen', etc
ls Pete?        -> will match 'Peter' but not rest from above
ls Pete?*       -> will match everything from above except 'Pete'
ls Pete[r,rsen] -> will match 'Peter' and 'Petersen'

!41             -> This runs the 41-th cmd from your 'history' eg: history

cat /etc/passw | grep penguin ; su penguin ; cd /home/penguin/data -> eg ; = multiple cmds
```

### 4.1 Bash variables

**Remark:** All variables exits only in the shel and not the child shells (cfr bash in bash) unless you **EXPORT** them !!!

```
PS1='\u@\h$ '               -> defines the prompt variable with 'user@host$'
myCar = 'Mustang'
```

### 4.2 Redirection

- **<** = redirect input
- **>** = redirect output

```
* '> file'      -> redirects stdout to file
* '1> file'      -> redirects stdout to file
* '2> file'      -> redirects stderr to file
* '&> file'      -> redirects stdout and stderr to file
```

grep penguin < /etc/passwd -> take '/etc/passwd' as input for grep

```
cat /etc/passwd | grep penguin > mylog.txt -> output of 'cat+grep' is redirected to file. Thus not visible on screen.
```

### 4.3 Bash customization

- ~/.profile -> for environment variables (cfr \$PATH) + NON specific bash config (must support bash/Zsh/..etc)
- ~/.bashrc -> for interactive bash settings: bash aliases, bash prompt, favorite editor etc
- ~/.bash_profile -> loading ~/.profile + ~/.bashrc (rem ubuntu has no .bash_profile but .profile)

example '~/.bash_profile'

```
. ~/.profile<br>
. ~/.bashrc
```

#### Sourcing a File

**Sourcing a file** means 'reading' the file and 'executing' every line in this file as if it was typed at the prompt. If we edit '.bash_profile' we have to 'run' this file to take effect.

```
source .bash_profile <br>
. .bash_profile = same as above (cfr 'type .' )
```

### 4.4 Prompts

Ther are 4 prompts

- PS1 = primary (normal) prompt
- PS2 = when entering a incomplete command -> default = '>' = means enter more stuff
- PS3 = when using a 'select' statement - when scripting
- PS4 = when debugging

PS1 and PS2 are mostly used.

#### PS2 example

While 'true' + enter -> prompt becomes 'PS2'. Then we enter some commands and after executing we return to PS1. Result: do 'ls' and after 10 sec clear screen.

```
\$ while true

> do ls -al sleep 10 clear done
```

**Remark:** Set PS2 = "Did you forget something? #" -> this way it will be ealisy noticed if you mistyped something! Don't foreget to EXPORT is in .bashrc

### 4.5 Aliases

```
alias -> lists all aliases alias l='ls -laih' -> l=long a=all i=Inode nr h=human readable size (K/M/G) <br>
alias mydate='date +"%d:%m:%Y"' -> output = '13:04:2019'
```

### 4.6 functions

This is the next thing after 'aliases'. Ideal for executing multiple commands at once. Function are run in memory and are therfore faster than scripts or aliases

You can add them in '.bashrc' and call them in the shell. eg: 'myRef'

```
function myRef () { source ~/.profile source ~/.bashrc clear date }
```

### 4.7 set and shopt (shell options)

Both are used to config various parameters of the shell.

```
set -o -> lists all set parameters

set -o noclobber -> 'to clobber = overwrite unintentionally ! '-o turns it ON'= you can NOT overwrite (default) set +o noclober -> '+o turns it FF' -> you can overwrite a file
```

```
shopt -> list all shopt parameters shopt -s cdspell -> tries to correct and match existing cmd
```

```
shopt login_shell           -> if it returns Off then => 'non login shell' (cfr bash in Docker or Mac)
                            -> if Onn => login shell (cfr SSH)
```

**Remark:** Difference is that with 'login shell'- reads .bash_profile **AND** .bashrc With 'non login shell' - it **ONLY** sources (reads) '.bashrc' !!!

### 5 Networking

**Remark:** you may need to install some libraries if 'cmd not found

```
apt-get update
apt-get install iputils-ping            -> needed for ping
apt-get install dnsutils                -> needed for dig
```

#### Utilities

- ping
- traceroute
- ftp
- scp
- ssh
- dig
- host
- whois
- telnet
- ifconfig

#### Network Files & Directories

- /etc/hosts
- /etc/nsswitch.conf
- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
- /etc/resolv.conf

**ping**

```
ping -c 5 google.com
```

ipv6

```
ping6 -v -I ip6tn10 2a00:1450:400e:80d::200e
                            -> -v = verbose -I= interface out (ip6tn10)
                            -> tip: make alias: 'alias p6='ping6 -v -I ip6tn10'
p6 2a00:1450:400e:80d::200e -> used with the alias
```

**Remark :** Define your ip addresses + hostname in 'hosts' to make yor life easier eg: 192.168.2.234 fw -> 'ping fw'

**traceroute**

```
traceroute google.com
```

**dig**

A tool to troubleshoot and solve DNS problems

```
dig wizzkid.com             -> queries the (default) DNS server and returns (default) 'A record'
dig @8.8.8.8 wizzkid.be     -> idem but now we specify a (other) DNS server
dig wizzkid.be MX           -> idem but returns MX (mail) record
dig wizzkid.be NS           -> returns 'Authoritative' Name Servers (holds the records)
dig wizzkid.be TXT
```

**host**

```
host                        -> list all host options
host -v  google.com         -> verbose - detail info: A, AAAA, MX, etc records
```

**ifconfig**

```
ifconfig -a                 -> all ip/ipv6 - MAC info
```

### Network Files

- /etc/hosts -> for configuring hostnames & Ip addresses
- /etc/nsswitch.conf -> dictates where to look first: locally/server x,.. ! cfr DNS, passwords,..
- /etc/resolv.conf -> resolve restrictions eg: max 3 DNS entries

### 6 System

#### 6.1 General

Start sequence:

1. Bios
2. master bootloader (=part of the disk)
3. kernel

#### 6.2 System Security

**TCP Wrappers**

- /etc/hosts.allow
- /etc/hosts.deny

In both files yo can specifiy what TCP connection can be allowed
